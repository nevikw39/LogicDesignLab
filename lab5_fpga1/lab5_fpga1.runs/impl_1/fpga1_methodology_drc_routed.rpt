LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell kd/tone[4]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) cnt_reg/CLR, tone_reg[0]/CLR, tone_reg[0]_replica/CLR,
tone_reg[0]_replica_1/CLR, tone_reg[0]_replica_2/CLR, tone_reg[1]/CLR,
tone_reg[2]/CLR, tone_reg[2]_replica/CLR, tone_reg[2]_replica_1/CLR,
tone_reg[2]_replica_2/CLR, tone_reg[3]/CLR, tone_reg[3]_replica/CLR,
tone_reg[3]_replica_1/CLR, tone_reg[3]_replica_2/CLR,
tone_reg[3]_replica_3/CLR (the first 15 of 21 listed). The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
